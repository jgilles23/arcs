    Variables: 
        population_size_i is the population size at iteration i (index 0)
        ?survivor_fraction_i need some way to establish the next population
        heat_i is how much to vary the initial population for the next iteration
            1 = completely random
            0 = no change at all
            as a linear interpolation between a new random value and what is in the population
        trial_size_i is the number of trials to run on each member of the population
